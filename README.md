# IDC_14DaysChallenge_DAY3

Day3 Completed- Databricks 14 days AI challenge

I have completed my Day3 of Databricks AI challenge and I am motivated to be consistent with this lerning

### What I Learnt today:

- PySpark vs Pandas comparison
- Joins (inner, left, right, outer)
- Window functions (running totals, rankings)
- User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Loaded full e-commerce dataset
2. Performed complex joins
3. Calculated running totals with window functions
4. Created derived features

Grateful for the support and initiative by @Databricks, @Codebasics and @indiandataclub along with #DatabricksWithIDC
